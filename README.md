* 👋 Hi, I'm @Romweiler 🇫🇷 — marketer turned builder, based in Bali 🌴
* 🔧 I build side-projects at the intersection of marketing & tech. Currently shipping Shado — a free Chrome extension that turns LinkedIn's Ad Library into a competitive intelligence tool.
* 👀 Into B2B advertising, product design, AI-assisted workflows, futsal, cycling, and learning languages (Indonesian, Balinese, Russian).
* 🌱 Learning by building — extensions, automations, and whatever solves a real problem.
* 💞️ Open to collab with makers & marketers, especially on local projects in Bali.
* 📫 Text me — and if you're in Bali, let's grab a coffee 🤙
