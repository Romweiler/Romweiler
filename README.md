* Hi, I'm @Romweiler — marketer turned builder, based in Bali 
* I build side-projects at the intersection of marketing & tech. Currently shipping Shado — a free Chrome extension that turns LinkedIn's Ad Library into a competitive intelligence tool.
* Into B2B advertising, product design, AI-assisted workflows, futsal, cycling, and learning languages (Indonesian, Balinese, Russian).
* Learning by building — extensions, automations, and whatever solves a real problem.
* Open to collab with makers & marketers, especially on local projects in Bali.
* Text me — and if you're in Bali, let's grab a coffee
